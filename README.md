# Advent Of Code 2023

Here are solutions to the [2023 advent of code problems](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)
written in rust. The build uses [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html);
to run use `cargo run --release [all|<day number>]` in the project directory (this will require either
a file `cache/.session_cookie` containing your session cookie with
[adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com/2023/), or text files like `cache/day3.in`
with the input for each day you intend to run).
